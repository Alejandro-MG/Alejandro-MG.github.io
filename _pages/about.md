I am an Assistant Professor at the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.uark.edu/) and a member of the [Institute for Integrative and Innovative Research](https://i3r.uark.edu/) at the [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/). Before receiving this appointment, I worked as an Assistant Research Professor at the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Chair for Computer-Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality (CAMP) at the Technical University of Munich and hold master's and bachelor's degrees in Electronic Engineering from the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi and the Technical Institute of Aguascalientes, Mexico. 

My research interests focus on understanding the properties of human sensory and cognitive systems in order to create efficient, intuitive, understandable, and transferable XR experiences and include visual perception, extended reality, and their integration into interventional medicine and surgical robotics. I aim to combine fundamental principles of psychophysical theories and human-computer interaction to design perceptually-aware XR systems that efficiently fuse real and virtual content into a single world.
