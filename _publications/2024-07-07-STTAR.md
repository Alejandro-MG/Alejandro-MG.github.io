excerpt: 'This work presents a framework that uses the built-in cameras of Augmented Reality (AR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) to enable accurate tracking of retro-reflective markers without the need to integrate any additional electronics into the HMD. The proposed framework can simultaneously track multiple tools without having previous knowledge of their geometry and only requires establishing a local network between the headset and a workstation. Our results show that the tracking and detection of the markers can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.09 ± 0.06 mm on lateral translation, 0.42 ± 0.32 mm on longitudinal translation and 0.80 ± 0.39◦ for rotations around the vertical axis.'
