excerpt: 'In this work, we propose a framework for autonomous robotic navigation for subretinal injection, based on intelligent real-time processing of intraoperative Optical Coherent Tomography (iOCT) volumes. Our method consists of an instrument pose estimation method, an online registration between the robotic and the iOCT system, and trajectory planning tailored for navigation to an injection target. We also introduce intelligent virtual B-scans, a volume slicing approach for rapid instrument pose estimation, which is enabled by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).'
