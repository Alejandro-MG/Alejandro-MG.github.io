excerpt: 'In this work, we introduce a novel framework using mixed reality technologies to ease the use of Robotic-Assisted Medical Systems (RAMS). The proposed framework achieves real-time planning and execution of medical instruments by providing 3D anatomical image overlay, human-robot collision detection, and robot programming interface. These features, integrated with an easy-to-use calibration method for head-mounted display, improve the effectiveness of human-robot interactions.'
