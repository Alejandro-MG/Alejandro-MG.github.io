excerpt: 'This work introduces a novel framework that enables the localisation of necrotic lesions in Computed Tomography (CT) as a step toward localising and visualising necrotic lesions in intra-operative images. The proposed framework enables the automatic segmentation of femur, pelvis, and necrotic lesions in MRI. An additional step performs semi-automatic segmentation of these anatomies, excluding the necrotic lesions, in CT. A final step performs pairwise registration of the corresponding anatomies, allowing for the localisation and visualisation of the necrosis in CT. This framework was tested on MRIs and CTs containing early-stage ONFH.'
