excerpt: 'Navigated surgery enables physicians to perform complex tasks assisted by virtual representations of surgical tools and anatomical structures visualized using intraoperative medical images. Integrating Augmented Reality (AR) in these scenarios enriches the virtual information presented to the surgeon by utilizing a wide range of visualization techniques. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to conveying additional depth and shape information of the augmented content using dynamic visualization techniques. Compared to existing works, these techniques allow users to gather information not only from pictorial but also from kinetic depth cues.'
