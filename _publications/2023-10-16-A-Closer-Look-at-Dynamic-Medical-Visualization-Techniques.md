excerpt: 'In navigated surgery, physicians perform complex tasks assisted by virtual representations of anatomical structures and surgical tools. Integrating Augmented Reality (AR) in these scenarios enriches the information presented to the surgeon through a range of visualization techniques. Their selection is a crucial task as they represent the primary interface between the system and the surgeon. In this work, we present a novel approach to conveying augmented content using dynamic visualization techniques, allowing users to gather depth and shape information from both pictorial and kinetic cues.'
