excerpt: 'In this work, we introduce SAMM Extended (SAMME), a platform that integrates new Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant models, adopts faster communication protocols, accommodates new interactive modes, and allows for fine-tuning of subcomponents of the models. These features can expand the potential of foundation models like SAM, and the results can be translated to applications such as image-guided therapy, mixed reality interaction, robotic navigation, and data augmentation.'
