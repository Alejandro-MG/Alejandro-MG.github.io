excerpt: 'In this work, we propose a 2D/3D registration pipeline that aims to register preoperative MRI with intraoperative 2D fluoroscopic images. To showcase the feasibility of our approach, we use the core decompression procedure as a surgical example to perform 2D/3D femur registration. The proposed registration pipeline is evaluated using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) to simulate the intraoperative fluoroscopic images. The resulting transformation from the registration is later used to create overlays of preoperative MRI annotations and planning data to provide intraoperative visual guidance to surgeons.'
