excerpt: 'In natural viewing conditions, the brain can optimally integrate retinal and extraretinal signals to maintain a stable visual perception. These mechanisms, however, may fail in circumstances where extraction of a motion signal is less viable such as impoverished visual scenes. This can result in a phenomenon known as autokinesis in which one may experience apparent motion of a small visual stimulus in an otherwise completely dark environment. In this study, we examined the effect of autokinesis on visual perception of motion in human observers. We used a novel method with optical tracking in which the visual motion was reported manually by the observer. Experiment results show at lower speeds of motion, the perceived direction of motion was more aligned with the effect of autokinesis, whereas in the light or at higher speeds in the dark, it was more aligned with the actual direction of motion. These findings have important implications for understanding how the stability of visual representation in the brain can affect accurate perception of motion signals.'
