permalink: /publication/2024-05-13-UncertaintyAwareShapeEstimation.md
excerpt: 'In this work, we introduce a novel method capable of directly estimating a Continuum Dexterous Manipulator's shape from Fiber Bragg Grating sensor wavelengths using a deep neural network. In addition, we propose the integration of uncertainty estimation to address the critical issue of uncertainty in neural network predictions. Neural network predictions are unreliable when the input sample is outside the training distribution or corrupted by noise. Recognizing such deviations is crucial when integrating neural networks within surgical robotics, as inaccurate estimations can pose serious risks to the patient.'
