excerpt: 'This paper defines the basic components of any Augmented Reality (AR) solution and extends them to exemplary Medical Augmented Reality Systems (MARS). We use some of the original MARS applications developed at the Chair for Computer-Aided Medical Procedures and deployed into medical schools for teaching anatomy and into operating rooms for telemedicine and surgical guidance throughout the last decades to identify the corresponding basic components. In this regard, the paper is not discussing all past or existing solutions but only aims at defining the principle components and discussing the particular domain modeling for MAR and its design-development-validation process, and providing exemplary cases through the past in-house developments of such solutions.'
